<h1 style="font-weight: 100;">About</h1>

<p>Digital Marketing and Social Media Marketing were my favorite subjects at the University of Nevada, Reno. I really liked the digital side of marketing and I even scored a job after college using it to grow a small business brand. As my work continued, I was tasked to manage the company's wordpress site and a content marketing campaign. As I learned the very basics of a wordpress website I became very interested in learning more. A year after I graduated with a Marketing degree, I was back at UNR persuing an Information Systems degree. 
<br />
Persuing my Information Systems degree took two years and in the process I was able to take six programming specific courses: three mandatory, two electives and a Capstone course. My mandatory classes taught me Internet Programming I, Software Development and Database Design. In the process I learned the core languages used in web development including HTMl, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, AJAX and JSON. Additionally, I learned the basics of programming using Visual Basic and became familiar with designing databases and programming them using SQL. 
<br />
My first elective course, Android Programming, exposed me to the basics of Mobile app development through the use of C# and Xamarin for Visual Studio. For a final project, I created a basic Apple application for the course (using Xamarin) which could be tested and run on Apple devices through Visual Studio. My second elective course, Internet Programming II, exposed me to the world of Server Side Development. The class detailed how to create full MVC's using Visual Studio, how to build API's and even exposed us to legacy AST.NET applications. The final project was another extended study assigment where I learned the Ruby programming language and developed a full MVC Applciation utilizing an SQL database. 
<br />
My final Captsone course, Information Systems Management, required me to create an entire software application for a client over a three month SCRUM Project with three other team members. Throughout the project our team went through the SCRUM Process and included two Sprints during which we developed and delivered a working product to our client. The project was successful and the client was please with the resul.  
<br />
I continue to work on my own projects using Ruby/Rails, Java Android Application, C# API and MVC Applications while also trying to contrubute to public repositories on GitHub.
