<h1 style="font-weight: 100;">About</h1>

<p>Digital Marketing and Social Media Marketing were my favorite subjects at UNR. I liked the digital side of marketing and I even scored a job after college using it to grow the company's brand. As my work continued I was put in charge of the company's wordpress site and a content marketing campaign. As I learned the very basics of a wordpress website I became very interested in learning more. A year after I graduated with a Marketing degree, I was back at UNR persuing an Information Systems degree. </p>
<p>Persuing my Information Systems degree took two years and in the process I was able to take six programming specific courses: three mandatory, two electives and a Capstone course. The courses included Internet Programming, Software Development, Databsase Design, Android Programming, Server-side programming and a capstone course focused on real-world development using SCRUM Methodology. In the process I learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, AJAX, JSON, Visual Basic, C#, Xamarin for Visual Studio, SQL, .NetCore, and some legacy ASP.NET. </p>
<p>During school, and even now, I am continually teaching myself new languages and frameworks like Java with Andriod Studio and Ruby on Rails. Im constantly trying to learn more and each day the list of things I want to learn continues to grow. Currently PHP, Kotlin and Node JS are at the top of my list. Now all I need is an opportunity to work in the industry where I can put all my hard work into practice. If you know of any opportunities out there, please do not hesitate to contact me. </p>
